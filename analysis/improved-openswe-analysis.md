## Detailed System Analysis

### **System Integration Points**

The Enhanced Open SWE maintains seamless integration with the existing LangGraph architecture while extending it with sophisticated multi-agent capabilities:

#### **LangGraph Configuration** (`langgraph.json`)
```json
{
  "graphs": {
    "programmer": "./apps/open-swe/src/graphs/programmer/index.ts:graph",
    "planner": "./apps/open-swe/src/graphs/planner/index.ts:graph", 
    "manager": "./apps/open-swe/src/graphs/manager/index.ts:graph"
  }
}
```

#### **Enhanced Graph State**
The system extends the existing GraphState to support multi-agent orchestration while maintaining backward compatibility with existing workflows.

#### **Feature Flags** (`packages/shared/src/open-swe/index.ts`)
The implementation includes comprehensive feature flags for gradual rollout and testing:

```typescript
export const FeatureFlags = {
  ENABLE_ADVANCED_ORCHESTRATION: true,
  ENABLE_REPOSITORY_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH: true,
  ENABLE_PRINCIPAL_ENGINEER_REVIEWS: true,

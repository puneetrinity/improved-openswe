  <h1>🚀 Enhanced Open SWE - Principal Engineer AI Code Review System</h1>
</div>

> **The only asynchronous, enterprise-ready AI coding agent with Principal Engineer-level code review intelligence and native GitHub workflow integration**

Enhanced Open SWE is a comprehensive multi-agent enhancement of the original Open SWE that transforms it from a basic coding agent into a sophisticated **Principal Engineer-level AI system** with advanced code review capabilities, semantic understanding, and continuous learning.

## ✨ **What's New in Enhanced Open SWE**

### 🏆 **From Basic Automation to Principal Engineer Intelligence**

**Original Open SWE:**
```
User → Manager → Planner → Programmer → Basic Reviewer → Result  
```

**Enhanced Open SWE:**
```
User → Intelligent Orchestration → 6 Specialized Agents (Parallel)
                                      ↓
    Repository Knowledge Graph ← → Historical Context System
                                      ↓
    Principal Engineer-Level Quality Output
```
